# Browser Tree
## Take Control Over Your Tabs

Browser Tree gives you control over your tabs like no other Web Browser out there. It's built on Chromium and Node (with Electron) so you're going to get Google Chrome Speeds if not faster.

With Chrome built in we get access to fast individual processes per tab ensuring speed and security.

With NodeJS built in we get access to a fast non-blocking API and over 250K (and growing) modules to work with.

### Build Locally
`npm install && npm start`
