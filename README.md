## Take Control Over Your Tabs

Browster gives you control over your tabs like no other Web Browser out there. It's built on Chromium and Node (with Electron)

With Chrome built in we get access to fast individual processes per tab ensuring speed and security.

With NodeJS built in we get access to a fast non-blocking API and over 250K (and growing) modules to work with.
